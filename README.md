#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is the process of designing, developing and maintaining software.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance.
Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
Security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
.mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification.
Design - building the framework.
Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification.
Design - building the framework.
Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.
- there is Low flexibility,changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints).
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements.
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.
   
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineer face complexity and technical debts. They have time pressure and deadlines. Struggling to communicate and do teamwork. They must be updated with the recent technologies. Software engineer experience debugging and troubleshooting. Burnout and self care. 

In order to deal with this challenges, they must break down problems. Prioritize tasks and focus. They must keep on learning new things. Use systemic approach to solve problems and lastly prioritize self- care. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The art of crafting questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models. 
It helps in getting clear and accurate responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A full-body portrait of a young woman with long black hair, wearing a red long, studying in library on a sunny day with shelves and books in the background.

Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.

Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long black hair, red long dress) and the setting (library, sunny day, shelves, books) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.

Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
